A simple image search app in Kotlin.

## General
- We all go the the Playstore to download various wallpaper apps and services that allow to download and set beautiful wallpapers to customize our Home and Lockscreens.
- There are various apps available on the Playstore and not all of them are good.
- I took this opportunity and my passion for Android Development and learning new things to create my very own Wallpaper and Image Search App from scratch.
